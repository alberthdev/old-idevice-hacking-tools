#
# This is a general-purpose makefile for use with GNU make. It can be downloaded
# from http://www.waxworlds.org/edam/software/general-purpose-makefile where you
# can also find more information and documentation on it's use. The following
# text can only really be considered a reference to it's use.
#
# To use this makefile, put a file named "Makefile" in your project directory.
# Add all your project's settings to your Makefile and then include this file
# from it. For example, your Makefile might look something like this:
#
#       TARGET = my_program
#       SOURCES = main.cc foo.cc
#       LIBRARIES = bar
#       include ~/src/edam.mk
#
# A complete list of all the settings you can use in your Makefile follows. It
# should be noted, though, that some settings are better defined in the shell's
# environment and/or specified on the make command line than hard-coded straight
# in to the Makefile. For example, the "DEBUGMODE" is an ideal candidate for
# exporting from your shell:
#       export DEBUGMODE=1
# and overridding on the command line when necessary:
#       make DEBUGMODE=
#
# It should also be noted that boolean parameters should either be undefined (or
# defined as an empty string) for "off", and defined as "1" for "on"; as in the
# above example with setting DEBUGMODE.
#
# Here is a list of all configuration parameters:
#
# DEBUGMODE    Boolean. Build a debugable version of the target suitable for
#              debugging with gdb. It's probably better to set this from the
#              command line or the shell's environment than to hard-code it.
# PROFILEMODE  Boolean. When set, DEBUGMODE is also implied. Build a profiling
#              version of the target, for use with gprof. It's probably better
#              to set this from the command line or the shell's environment
#              than to hard-code it.
#
# NOLINK       Boolean. Don't link the object file.
#
# LINKSTATIC   Boolean. Set to build a target that staticly links against all
#              its libraries and doesn't use shared libraries.
#
# MKSTATICLIB  Boolean. Target type: Set to build a static library target. If
#              neither this nor MKSHAREDLIB are set, the target defaults to a
#              binary executable.
# MKSHAREDLIB  Boolean. Target type: Set to build a shared library target. If
#              neither this nor MKSTATICLIB are set, the target defaults to a
#              binary executable.
# NOLIBPREFIX  Boolean. When building a static or shared library, do not ensure
#              that the target's name is prefixed with "lib".
#
# TARGET       The name of the target file.
#
# SOURCES      A list of all source files of whatever language. The language
#              type is determined by the file extension.
#
# LIBRARIES    A list of libraries to link against. Don't include the 'lib'
#              prefix.
#
# SUBDIRS      A list of subdirectories to build before attempting to build the
#              target. These subdirectories are also included in a clean_all.
#              Note that if the file 'emake.mk' exists in a subdirectory, it
#              will be used explicitly, rather than any default makefile.
#
# SUBPROJS     A list of the names of other makefiles to run before attempting
#              to build the target. This allows you to build multiple targets.
#              Note that ".mk" is appended to the subproject names. These
#              subprojects are also included in a clean_all.
#
# INCLUDES     List of include file search paths
# CPPFLAGS     Flags to give to the C and C++ compilers
# CFLAGS       Flags to give to the C compiler
# CXXFLAGS     Flags to give to the C++ compiler
# DFLAGS       Flags to give to the D compiler
# ASFLAGS      Flags to give to the assembler
# LDFLAGS      Flags to give to the linker before librarys
# LDPOSTFLAGS  Flags to give to the linker after libraries
#
# This general-purpose makefile also defines the following goals for use on the
# command line when you run make:
#
# all          This is the default if no goal is specified. It builds subdirs
#              and subprojects first and then the target.
#
# subdirs      Goes through the list of specified subdirectories, changing to
#              them, and runs make there.
#
# subprojs     Goes through the list of specified subprojects, running the
#              makefiles for each of them.
#
# target       Builds the target of your Makefile.
#
# run          Builds the target of your Makefile and, if successful, runs it.
#              This is not available if you're building a library of some kind.
#
# clean        Deletes temporary files.
#
# clean_all    Deletes temporary files and then goes through then project's
#              subdirectories doing the same.
#
# <subdir>     Builds the specified subdirectory from those that are listed for
#              the project.
#
# <subproj>    Builds the specified subproject from those listed for the
#              project.
#
# <file>       Builds the specified file, either an object file or the target,
#              from those that that would be built for the project.
#
# Please report any problems to Tim Marston <edam@waxworlds.org>
#
# Known shortcommings:
# - Using C is probably broken because g++ is currently used for linking. We
#   should be using ld and specifying the crt libs as required by the sources.
