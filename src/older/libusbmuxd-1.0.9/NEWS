Version 1.0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes:
  * Avoid SIGPIPE where possible
  * Plugged several memory leaks and invalid frees
  * Fixed concurrency issues caused by tag mismatch
  * Added new interface functions for pair record management via usbmuxd:
    - usbmuxd_read_pair_record()
    - usbmuxd_save_pair_record()
    - usbmuxd_delete_pair_record()
    - usbmuxd_read_buid()
  * Made libplist dependency (and thus protocol v1 support) mandatory
  * Improved usbmuxd_get_device_list() with new ListDevices usbmuxd command
  * Fixed WIN32 (MinGW) build

This is the first release after the usbmuxd/libusbmuxd project split.
