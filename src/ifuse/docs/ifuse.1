.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ifuse MOUNTPOINT [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mount directories of an iOS device locally using fuse. By default the media
directory is mounted, options allow to also mount the sandbox container of an
app, an app's documents folder or even the root filesystem on jailbroken
devices.

Example:

$ ifuse /media/iPhone \-\-root

This mounts the root filesystem of the first attached device on
this computer in the directory /media/iPhone.

Regular users are able to unmount fuse mounts using "fusermount -u MOUNTPOINT".
